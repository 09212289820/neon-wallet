# Neon Wallet alpha release

Neon wallet is a light wallet that allows you to interact with assets on the Neo blockchain without waiting to sync all chain data locally to your machine.

## Features

Neon wallet currently supports:

  + Offline Generation of new accounts (public/private key pairs)
  + Checking NEO and GAS balance
  + Sending NEO and GAS
  + Claiming GAS
  + Easy switching between MainNet and TestNet

## Alpha release disclaimer

Our team at COZ is currently using this wallet on MainNet and TestNet without issue, but as an alpha release, we advise you to *only use this wallet on TestNet* until the code has been fully audited by the community. If you would like to try the wallet on TestNet, ping unignorant in the COZ slack and we will send you a small amount of TestNet funds.  

## Download links

You can compile the wallet yourself using the instructions in the [readme](../README.md), but we have compiled standalone apps for non-technical users.
