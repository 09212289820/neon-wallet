The aim of this project is to port the current NEO webwallet to electron with a better UI. 

This is more or less a template at the moment.

As for a node version, this project uses the current LTS version, which is `v6.11.0`

You'll need to have webpack installed globally `npm install -g webpack`

To install the development version, move into the project directory and run `npm install`. Then build the project with `web pack` or `webpack --watch` (for auto-updates).

To run the wallet: `npm start`
